- User story: I can see a page following the given design
- User story: I can input email, phone, full name, address, city, country, and postal code
- User story: I can input the number of items
- User story: I can select at least 3 countries from the dropdown
- User story: When I click submit button or press enter, I can see a warning if validation fails
- User story: When I click submit button or press enter, I can see a successful alert if validation succeeds
